## Introduction
One of the basic coding problems that is used to train beginers is a basic number guessing game.
This type of software is simple in funtionality and easy to program but, it is not that much interesting to play this game as it being less dynamic and boring in nature. The probability of the user winning is 5% if the number to be guessed is between 1 and 100 and the user is provided with 5 turns.

I have tried to make it interesting and worked hard on increasing the probability of user winning, with the help of an algorithm programed by me.

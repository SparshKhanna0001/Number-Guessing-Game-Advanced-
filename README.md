## Introduction
One of the basic coding problems that is used to train beginers is a basic number guessing game.
This type of software is simple in funtionality and easy to program but, it is not that much interesting to play this game as it being less dynamic and boring in nature. The probability of the user winning is 5% if the number to be guessed is between 1 and 100 and the user is provided with 5 turns.

I have tried to make it interesting and worked hard on increasing the probability of user winning, with the help of an algorithm programed by me.--

## Long Story Short
__Ordinary Number Guessing Game__ : You have five turns, guess the number between 1 and 100. 
                                    Winning Probability : 0.05
                                    
__Intermeditiate Number Guessing Game__ : Everything is same except one improvement. Here the machine provides you hint like _the number you guessed is too low_ __OR__ 
                                          _the number you guessed is too high_. This although provides the user with some insight but that not enough.
                                          
The type of number guessing games described above are __good for coding practices__ but actually are __boring in nature.__
I have tried to make it interesting to play.

###My Number Guessing Game :
Suppose gave a wrong guess the following describes how the computer/machine you're using responds:- 
>>>This time you were not able to make it up.
>>>As a hint, the number lies between 32 and 47. 
>>>Please try again !!!
                              
Everytime you lose the program will give you lose the program will give _the range in which correct option lies_.
__But, does the program give you same range__
_No, it will don't_.  
* First Time you lose : range between

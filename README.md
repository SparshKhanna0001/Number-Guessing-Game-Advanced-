## Long Story Short
__Ordinary Number Guessing Game__ : You have five turns, guess the number between 1 and 100. 
                                    Winning Probability : 0.05
                                    
__Intermeditiate Number Guessing Game__ : Everything is same except one improvement. Here the machine provides you hint like _the number you guessed is too low_ __OR__ 
                                          _the number you guessed is too high_. This although provides the user with some insight but that not enough.
                                          
The type of number guessing games described above are __good for coding practices__ but actually are __boring in nature.__
I have tried to make it interesting to play.

### My Number Guessing Game :
Suppose gave a wrong guess the following describes how the computer/machine you're using responds:- 
>>>This time you were not able to make it up.
>>>As a hint, the number lies between 32 and 47. 
>>>Please try again !!!

Everytime you lose the program will give _the range in which correct option lies_.
__But, does the program give you same range__
_No, it will don't_.  
* First Time you lose : range of 15 numbers
* Second Time you lose : range of 10 numbers
* Third Time you lose : range of 5 numbers 
* Fourth Time you lose : range of 3 numbers


## Future Developments

* May add __Graphical User Interface.__ 
* May add a __database to store users scores__ and to implement a __functionality that saves highscores.__
* Since, it a simple game so may be in future i may __integrate this game with other games of this type to a single platform__.
